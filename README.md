# Facebook Pages Messages Scraper

I created this scraper during the time I was managing a Facebook Page and I wanted to search for emails that people have send me during that time. 

The number of people who wrote to this page was huge and searching through every conversation would have taken a lot of time. As I was learning Python at that time I decided to create a simple scraper, especially because I already found out, that there is a Python module that helps you connect with Facebook's Graph API, which is basicly all I needed.

The scraper looks for regexes that match simple email adresses and saves them to a .txt file with a name and surname of the person who send you it.
